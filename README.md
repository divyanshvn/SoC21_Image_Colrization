# SoC21_Image_Colrization

After the Start of project (30/03/21 to 14/04/21) :
  
  Learnt about machine learning Basics(Gradient Descent Algorithm, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression) and the math behind them.
  
  (14/04/21 to 15/05/21 (endsem in between) ):
  
  Completed reading the book http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html (Neural Net and Deep Learning) and implemented Backprop for classifying handwritten digits.
  
  (15/05/21 to 24/05/21)
Completed the pytorch tutorials available at the official pytorch website

  (24/05/21 to 28/05/21)
Implemented AlexNet from Scratch to classify MNIST digits

  (29/05/21 to 05/06/21)
Implemented VGGNet to classify MNIST Digits.

  (05/06/21 to 12/06/21)
  Read about Resnet and GoogleNet
  
  (12/06/21 to 25/06/21)
  Read about GAN and Implemeted a Basic Generative Adversial Network (GAN) to generate MNIST digits.
  
  (28/06/21 to 01/07/21)
  Read the DCGAN paper and Implemented it to generate MNIST Handwritten Digits.
  
  (02/07/21 to 10/07/21)
  Read the pix2pix paper and several medium blogs related to it.
  
  (11/07/21 to 17/07/21)
